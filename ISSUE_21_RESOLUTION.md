# Issue #21 Resolution Summary

## Problem
Issue #21 was an incomplete bug report with only placeholder text from the template. The title was just "H" and the description contained all the unmodified template placeholders like "A clear and concise description of what the bug is."

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurred because:
1. The original bug report template was easy to accidentally submit without filling out
2. No validation existed to prevent template submissions
3. Users had no guidance on how to properly report issues
4. No diagnostic tools were available to help users before reporting

## Solution Implemented

### üîß Enhanced Issue Templates

- **Enhanced feature_request.md**: Better structure with priority levels and use case examples
